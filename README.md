### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name's Sidharth Babu, and I'm an Electrical and Computer Engineering Student at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm passionate about intelligent and performant software systems, and I love interacting and working on innovative projects whenever I get the chance! I'm particularly interested in distributed systems and performance optimization, especially in the ML Systems and automotive spaces. If you have a hard technical problem and a job opening, I'd love to hear about it!
Previously, I was a student at UT Austin (go Longhorns!) and an intern at Adobe, Keysight Technologies, and NASA.
